# Concrete-Strength-Prediction-Model
A concrete strength prediction model that takes user inputs and provides strength estimates and the uncertainty. Models used: Multiple Linear Regression​  Exponential Regression​  Polynomial Regression​

Objective(s):
Literature scan on concrete design, and utility of a predictive approach
Analyse an existing concrete compressive strength database and build a data model to predict the compressive strength of a concrete mixture.
Build an interface to allow users to enter concrete mixtures and return an estimated strength and an assessment of the uncertainty in the estimate
Build an interface to allow users to add observations to the underlying database, and automatically update the Data Model to incorporate the new observations
